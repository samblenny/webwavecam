# WebWaveCam

A wavelet filter webcam toy.

This applies wavelet filtering to the video stream of a USB webcam, built in
camera, or phone camera. The "squash average" feature works kind of like visual
low-cut filter that reduces the impact of gradients caused by uneven lighting.

You can try it out at
[samblenny.github.io/webwavecam/](https://samblenny.github.io/webwavecam/)

Potential Applications:

1. Playing around with image filtering for fun

2. Contrast enhancement and noise-reduction stage for 2D barcode decoders

3. Making 1-bit images with compressed dynamic range for use with 1-bit
   displays or thermal printers
